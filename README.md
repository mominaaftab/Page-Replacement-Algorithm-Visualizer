# Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Visualizer
Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer helps understand memory management by simulating algorithms like FIFO, LRU, and Optimal. It also covers deadlock scenarios, memory allocation strategies, and CPU scheduling techniques like FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin, making OS concepts interactive and easy to learn.
